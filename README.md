## Single Responsibility Principle ##

A class should have one and only one responsibility. All its method should work together to achieve a single goal.
Class should have only one reason to change. It can be changed multiple time over the period of time but within the context of that class. In simple word, it should have the contextual reason to change in the class.

E.g, if you are fetching a location of a user, it shoudl only fetch a location of user. if its model class - it should represent only one entity
